### What I learned

I learned to implement 'vw' and 'wh' as units for font-sizes. Gain knowledge usign onscroll event in JavaScript to change the hero background color and title colors.

### Continued development

I plan to implement more onclick event listeners to my project section that will change the backgorund color based on the project main color. May use onclick in JavaScript for this manipulation of the DOM.
